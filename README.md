# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
Pewlett Hackard is worried about the "Silver Tsunami" as many of their current employees are reaching retirement age.  We need to anaylize their employee records to determine the number of retiring employees per job title and to identify employees that are eligible to participate in their mentorship program.

## Resources:

Data Source: [retirement_titles.csv](retirement_titles.csv), [unique_titles.csv](unique_titles.csv), [retiring_titles.csv](retiring_titles.csv), [mentorship_eligibilty.csv](mentorship_eligibilty.csv)
 
Software: PostgreSQL v13.3, pgAdmin 4 v5.3
 
Code: [Employee_Database_challenge.sql](Employee_Database_challenge.sql)

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
